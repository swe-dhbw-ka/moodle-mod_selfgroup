Moodle Selfgroup activity module
====================================

Selfgroup is a activity module for Moodle which allows students to create their own groups or enrol for an existing group. Additionally the mapping of groups to existing groupings can be done by students.

Motivation
----------

Whereas administrators or teachers can create groups and assign them to existing groupings, students can only see these created groups. Students would need the fitting permission to create groups and groupings.
Most commonly that's not an option for a system used in university setting. What's more, most teachers or lecturers don't want to create groups in Moodle for every group formed in their real world course.

The intention is that students can create groups in Moodle on their own and edit the given group information every time needed to keep the others posted. Additionally students can enrol for an existing group or leave a group that was wrongly chosen.
Using the Selfgroup activity teachers or lecturers can concentrate on providing course material while students form groups on their own.
Additionally, groups can be mapped to existing groupings in the concerning course.

If the Groupoverview Plugin is installed groups an be categorized by students, too.
For the purpose of using badges the activity completion is implemented in this plugin. That means teachers can enable activity completion and award a badge as soon as a student is enrolled in a group.

Usage
-----

**Note**: It only makes sense to use this plugin if the group mode of the course is set to 'Visible Groups'. Keep in mind that even if this is not the case, students _will_ be able to see the other groups.

To benefit from the whole functionality of the Selfgroup module it is recommended to also install the Groupoverview Plugin. If this plugin is not installed there is _no categorisation_ of groups possible.

1. Add the module instance into the course.
2. Define whether activity completion is used or not.
3. Save the settings for the module instance.

As a student you can now create a group or enrol for an existing group. If you are already a member of a group you can edit provided information.

For the implementation of the Selfgroup plugin, [Pirkka Pyykkönen's Group self-selection plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_groupselect) was used as inspiration. It gave the idea of how a plugin for the creation and administration of groups by students could look like. Therefore, many thanks to Pirkka Pyykkönen!
